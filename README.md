# Octree And Barnes Hut Algorithm
### Description
This project is a **Data Oriented** implementation of a **Octree** using indexes rather than refrences to child and parent nodes.  In this method I am able to use the **[Unity Jobs System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/JobSystemOverview.html)** and **[Burst Compiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@1.0/manual/index.html)** to enable the code to run much faster than the reference based tree would be able too.  This was build to be implemented into my **[N-Body Simulation](https://github.com/RyanSzczepanski/N-Body-Physics-Unity)**.
